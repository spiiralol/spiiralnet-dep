## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security problem (eg. users able to run unautherized commands), please raise a GitHub issue immediately. 

If you find a major vulnerability, contact SpiiralMainia#7488 on Discord immediately and raise a GitHub issue. This will allow me to take the bot down to a) fix the problem and b) prevent further damage.
