### Who is this for?
Anyone! It's designed to be as user friendly as possible, so practically anyone can use it!

### Help! It's not working!
First of all check you have the following permissions;
```"MANAGE_MESSAGES"```

```"KICK_MEMBERS"```

```"BAN_MEMBERS"```

```"MANAGE_NICKNAMES"```

```"MUTE_MEMBERS"```

```"MANAGE_GUILD"```

```"ADMINISTRATOR"```

While you don't need all the permissions to use the bot, check if you have the ones related to what command you are trying to run.

If you have those permissions, and it still isn't working, open a ModMail ticket in the support server.

### Wait, I have more question that NEED answered.
If you have a urgent question or one that can't be answered, open a ModMail ticket in the support server.
